# DNS-Crypt
In my project, I have implemented two methods for dns security:

1. DNS CRYPT:
	here we have used python based encryption method to encrypt the hostname at packet level and for security 		purpose in response we are giving fake ip address and hostname to misguide the attacker
		
2. DNS OVER HTTPS:
	In this method we are using trained machine learning  model to classify the data with doh and non doh and then 		malicious or bening , which will stop the dns tunneling attack
			
more details regarding both implementation are in their respective folders.

In my GitHub project, I utilized some datasets that were larger than GitHub's file size limit of 100.00 MB. To overcome this limitation, I have uploaded these files in a separate folder called "DNS-crypt datasets," and you can access them from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IPD7SWDVwOQBCwx8bsTkeMmP-O8Z2sM7?usp=drive_link).

To incorporate these datasets into your local project, kindly follow these simple steps:

1. Click on the link provided to access the "DNS-crypt datasets" folder on Google Drive.
2. Download the four required files (in .csv format) from the folder.
3. Once downloaded, add these four files to the designated directory within our project: doh/processed_data/

By following these instructions, you'll be able to access and use the necessary datasets for the project. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. Thank you for your cooperation!
